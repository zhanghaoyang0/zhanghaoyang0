Hi, I am Haoyang Zhang. I studied bioinformatics in Sun Yat-sen University.

Iâ€™m currently working on population-based genetics studies [ResearchGate link](www.baidu.com).

I make some simple tools here, which I think useful in my analysis. I hope these tools may be useful to you too.

If you have comments, you can reach me with zhanghaoyang0@hotmail.com
